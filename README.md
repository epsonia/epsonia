# Epsiona

Epsiona is a Cyberpatriot practice image "creator".

The hope for Epsiona is for it to have a GUI interface for creating Cyberpatriot
practice images, and a config file, which the GUI writes to, though of course
you would be able to simply write to the config file.

Anyways, lets not get too ahead of ourselves into the future.

## Todo

- [x] Create HTML file for README
  - [x] Read from config file - Marky for parsing Markdown
- [ ] Create HTML file for checks (scoring report)
- [x] Config for creating the checks
- [x] Create a modular check system
  - [x] Check file exist
  - [ ] Check firewall up
  - [ ] Check directory permissions
  - [ ] Check file permissions
  - [ ] Check passwords - _**strongness**_
  - [ ] Check user permissions
