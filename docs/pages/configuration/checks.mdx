# Checks

Welcome to the checks configuration guide. This guide will help you
create the vulnerabilities for your Epsonia image.

The `checks.json` contains an object of various lists, and objects, each of them being
checks, except for some exceptions which have 2 or more in one config, to make terms easier.

## Guide for each check

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You should first setup the vulnerabilities in your image before creating the
  configuration.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Keep in mind that these checks are still in the works. There is more
  functionality coming to most of these checks.
</Callout>

### Users check (config)

Users is a list which contains object, each object being a user and their settings.
A user currently has 8 settings in Epsonia:

- `name`
- `shouldExist`
- `initialExist`
- `administrator`
- `points`
- `adminPoints`
- `message`
- `penaltyMessage`

#### Name

Name is the \*_username_ (not name) of the user, meaning it most likely is not capitalized
in any way.

#### Should exist

Should exist is pretty self explanitory, you simply state if the user should exist.

#### Initial Exist

Initial exist is if the user exists when the image is laucnhed by a competitor.

#### Administrator

Administrator is if the user should be an administrator.

#### Other

Points are how many points the user gets from removing/adding a user,
while admin points are how many points the competitor gains/loses if they grant/removed
a user's sudo privledges.

Message is the completion message shown in the scoring report for when the user finishes the
**user** (not administrator) vulnerability.

#### Twists

Keep in mind that there are a few twists to the users object: If you have a user
who should exist, and initially exists, it is not a check meaning that the check doesn't
get added to the vulnerabilities list, but is penatalized if the user removes said
user, because they are suppoed to exist, and they already exist, so the user removing
them would be **bad**.

Another twist is for if the user should exist, but doesn't initially exist - this
check is for a user who needs to be added

And finally, the last twist is that the administrator checks do not go along with
the user checks, they are parsed seperatly, meaning they are differnet checks, this goes back
to the start of the guide, where it says that some checks include checks in them.

#### Example User config

```json
  "users": [
    {
      "name": "albert",
      "shouldExist": false,
      "initialExist": true,
      "administrator": false,
      "points": 6,
      "adminPoints": 2,
      "message": "Malicous user Albert removed",
      "penaltyMessage": "Malicous user Albert has returned"
    },
    {
      "name": "frodo",
      "shouldExist": false,
      "initialExist": true,
      "administrator": false,
      "points": 6,
      "adminPoints": 2,

      "penaltyMessage": "Malicous user Frodo has returned"
    },
    {
      "name": "gandalf",
      "shouldExist": true,
      "initialExist": true,
      "administrator": true,
      "points": 8,
      "adminPoints": 2,
      "penaltyMessage": "User Gandalf removed"
    },
    {
      "name": "bilbo",
      "shouldExist": true,
      "initialExist": false,
      "administrator": true,
      "points": 8,
      "adminPoints": 2,

of the checks file. Though that is for later.

The forensics list has objects with the following attributes:

- `path`
