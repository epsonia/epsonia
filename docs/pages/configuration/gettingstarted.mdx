# Getting started with configuration

1. First, clone the Epsonia repository [↗](https://github.com/epsonia/epsonia).
2. To get started with this, create a folder in the root of the project named
   `"config"`.
3. Then, create three files in the config folder: `brief.md`, `checks.json`, and
   `config.json`

   - The `brief.md` file is the brief, also known as the Readme for the image.

   - The `checks.json` file is the place where you "state" your checks/vulns
   - Finally, the `config.json` file is the configuration for the image, this is
     what we'll be editing now.

4. Open up the `config.json`, and also open up the
   `exampleConfig/config.example.json`.

   - The `exampleConfig` folder contains example configs for all of these files.

5. Copy and paste everything from the example config to the `config.json` file.

Head over to the settings page [↗](/configuration/settings) to setup settings
